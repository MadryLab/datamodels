# <code>datamodels</code> example usage

<p>We include <b>simple examples</b> for both a <b>toy setting</b> and <b>CIFAR</b> in this directory.
        <ul>
                <li> <b>Toy Setting</b>: See <a href="examples/minimal/">example.sh</a> to see how the entire pipeline works together.</li>
<li> <b>CIFAR10</b>: See <a href="examples/cifar10/example.sh">example.sh</a>. It is a complete example, including data store creation, real model training, and logging. You must run this script from the root of the <code>datamodels</code> directory for it to work properly. </li>
                </ul>
